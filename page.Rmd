## 

Lower-level languages like C++ are especially suited for highly data- and computation-intensive applications. R programs tend to process large amounts of data, and often have significant independent data and task parallelism. 

R applications can draw tremendous parrallization and compute efficiency using GPU acceleration. This way, R users can benefit from Râ€™s high-level, user-friendly interface while achieving high performance.

This post is derived from the following article posted by NVidia: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/accelerate-r-applications-cuda/

##### Focus on three topics:
1. **Accelerating R computations using CUDA libraries**
2. **Calling your own parallel algorithms written in CUDA C/C++ or CUDA Fortran from R**
3. **Profiling GPU-accelerated R applications using the CUDA Profiler**

While there are R packages to access GPU power within R, an approach that yields more flexibility is *directly accessing GPUs through CUDA libraries or CUDA accelerated languages (C,C++) within R*.

To enable calling CUDA libraries within R, **we need to build an interface to bridge R and the CUDA development layer**, and for productivity, we should encapsulate these interface functions in the R environment.


### Accelerating R computations using CUDA libraries
Using GPU-accelerated libraries reduces development effort and risk, while providing support for many NVIDIA GPU devices with high performance. Thus, CUDA libraries are a quick way to speed up applications, without requiring the R user to understand GPU programming.

#### Writing an Interface Function
Functions we write with C (CUDA) need to satisfy several properties:

1. C functions called by R need to have a void return type
2. Results should be returned via function arguments
3. R passes all arguments to C functions by reference (using pointers), so we must dereference the pointers in C (even scalar input arguments)
4. Each file containing C functions to be called from R should include:
    + R.h
    + Header files for any CUDA libraries used by the function
